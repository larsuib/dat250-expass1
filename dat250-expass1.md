## technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have 
Most of the environment was already installed on my computer, however I figured I actually needed to use the `export PATH` in my `.zprofile` in order to call the binaries from anywhere on the CLI.
                                                                                  
## How you have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working
I went through the tutorial on Heroku, and I got the expected behaviour.          
                                                                                  
## Technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform and how you solved them
I was not able to do the plugin-step because I did not verify my account, and a credit card was needed to do that.
I solved this by simply not doing it. :slightly_smiling_face: I also struggled a bit in the start with the Postgres-plugin, but resolved this when I found out I was in the wrong directory...                    
                                                                                  
## Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve   
None as of now, except the issue with the plugin-step as explained above.
